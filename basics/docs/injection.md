Both constructor and setter injection result in the same outcome. However, there are some differences. Setter injection is more readable as it specifies the name of the dependency as the method name but the number of setter methods increases with each increasing dependency increasing the boiler plate code. Setter injection is used to avoid the BeanCurrentlyInCreationException raised in case of a circular dependency, because unlike constructor injection where dependencies are injected at the time when context is loaded, setter injection injects dependencies when they are needed.

Constructor injection ensures that all dependencies are injected because an object cannot be constructed until all its dependencies are available. It also ensures immutability as the state of the bean cannot be modified after creation.
