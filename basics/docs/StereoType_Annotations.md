Beans can be declared using the @Bean annotation in a configuration class or by using the @Controller, @Service, and @Repository annotations. These annotations are used at different layers of an enterprise application. A typical application has the following layers:



The web or UI layer interacts with the client program, the business layer takes care of the business logic, and the data layer interacts with a database or an external interface. @Component is a generic annotation. It can be used in any layer, if the developer is unsure about where the bean belongs. The other three annotations, @Controller, @Service, and @Repository, are specific to layers.


## @Controller#

@Controller is used to define a controller in the web layer. Spring scans a class with @Controller to find methods that are mapped to different HTTP requests. It makes sure that the right view is rendered to the user. @RestController is a specialized form of @Controller.

## @Service#

@Service is used in the business layer for objects that define the business logic. It marks a class as a service provider.



## @Repository#


@Respository is used in the data layer to encapsulate storage, retrieval, and search in a typical database. This annotation can also be used for other external sources of data.


In our application, RecommenderImplementation class has business logic so we can replace @Component with @Service. The filter algorithms also fall in the category of business logic, and thus we can use @Service on ContentBasedFilter and CollaborativeFilter classes. The Movie class loads movie data from a movie repository so we will replace the @Component annotation with @Repository annotation. When the application is run after changing the annotations, there is no change in terms of functionality.


The advantage of having annotations specific to every layer instead of the generic @Component is in Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). We can identify the annotations and add functionality to specific annotations. Similarly, we can classify components in different categories and apply a specific logic to each category. For example, if we want to log everything that is coming from the business layer, we can identify objects with the @Service annotation using AOP and log all the content.


Spring provides a default exception translation facility for JDBC exceptions if the @Repository annotation is used. This feature cannot be used on beans annotated with @Component. When using a persistence framework like Hibernate, exceptions thrown in a class with the @Repository annotation are caught and automatically translated into Spring’s DataAccessException class.


Likewise, the request mapping feature is enabled only when using the @Controller annotation. The DispatcherServlet automatically looks for @RequestMapping for classes marked with the @Controller annotation only.

The @Controller, @Service, and @Repository annotations are similar to @Component annotation with respect to bean creation and dependency injection, except that they provide specialized functionality.
